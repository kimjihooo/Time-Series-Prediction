# Time-Series-Prediction
LSTM Time Series Prediction Module

## 1) Train_LSTM Class
   
```
feature_importance_df()
```
: LSTM feature importance for all of features (permutation importance)
```
feature_importance_plot()
```
: Bars equal to the size of how much MAE worsened without each feature, which is the importance of each feature

## 2) Test_LSTM Class
```
plot_result()
```
: Plot to compare predicted and actual results
